# SQLite Project

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use SQLite, a self-contained, serverless, embedded database, in a project. The project includes examples of various SQLite features such as window functions, common table expressions, recursive queries, indexing, and transactions/concurrency control. It also shows how to use triggers for automating actions in response to specific events.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the SQLite project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

- SQLite (version 3.x or higher)
- Python (optional, for running Python scripts)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sqlite-project.git

2. Navigate to the project directory.

cd sqlite-project

3. Create a new SQLite database by running the SQL scripts to create tables, insert data, and set up triggers.

sqlite3 mydb.sqlite < create_tables.sql
sqlite3 mydb.sqlite < insert_data.sql
sqlite3 mydb.sqlite < create_triggers.sql


4. Optionally, you can run the Python scripts to perform various functions on the SQLite database.

python window_functions.py
python common_table_expressions.py
python recursive_queries.py
python indexing.py
python transactions_concurrency.py

## Usage

The project includes examples of various SQLite features and their usage. You can refer to the individual scripts and SQL files for detailed documentation and code comments.

- `window_functions.py`: Demonstrates the usage of window functions such as ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and NTILE() in SQLite.

- `common_table_expressions.py`: Shows how to use common table expressions (CTEs) in SQLite for recursive queries or complex data manipulations.

- `recursive_queries.py`: Provides examples of recursive queries in SQLite, which allow you to query hierarchical data.

- `indexing.py`: Shows how to create indexes in SQLite to optimize query performance for large datasets.

- `transactions_concurrency.py`: Demonstrates how to use transactions and handle concurrency control in SQLite to ensure data consistency and integrity.

- `create_tables.sql`, `insert_data.sql`, `create_triggers.sql`: SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting sample data, and setting up triggers in the SQLite database.
